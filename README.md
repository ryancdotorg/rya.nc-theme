Theme for rya.nc
================

This is a theme for use with [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/),
used on my site [rya.nc](https://rya.nc).

It is based on a WordPress theme called
"[Open Sourcerer](https://wordpress.org/themes/open-sourcerer/)".
I converted it for Pelican and made various modifications.
